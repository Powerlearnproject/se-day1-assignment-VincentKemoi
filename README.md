Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is an art of designing, developing, testing  and maintaining software applications with an aim of solving a real world problem. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Early computing- Early cmputers used hand-coded computer instructions.
Object Oriented Programming- The rise of OOP in 1980s like C++  Programming was a game changer.  
AI software Engineering- The automation in software engineering using AI tools like Copilot and GitHub which assist in writting codes.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Needs analysis- First, we identify the purpose or needs of the software. 
Design- Secondly, plan the architectural design of the software.
Coding- Writting the actual codes using programming languages. 
Testing- Performing tests to ensure that the sofware works well and meets the needs.
Release- Deploy the software for use. 
Maintenance- Sovving issues arising over time and making more improvements 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a well structured , step-by-step process while Agile methodologies is more of flexibility, collaboration and interactive progress.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software engineer- The role of a software engineer is to design, develope a software by writting codes using programming languages, testing the software and maintaining the software.
Quality Assurance Engineer- Is to ensure that the software meets the quality standards required before it is released for used. They do this by testing and identifying bugs and collaborating with software engineers to solve the issues arising. 
Project Manager- The role of a project manager is to plan, implement and oversee software development. Ensuring that the sofware is devoloped on time and within the budget. They also monitor and budget the process.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)- They help in writing codes in a fast manner hence leading to higher productivity.IDEs ensure high quality codes and reduce errors. IDEs also simplify learning for beginners.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with ever changing technologies. The technology keep changing rapidly which makes it difficult for engineers to keep up. To keep up, they should be flexible and ready to learn.
Finding bugs and troubleshooting- Identifing and getting rid of bugs can be frustrating and time consuming especially for large databases.
Meeting deadlines- Since writing codes and debugging is time consuming, software engineers find it challenging to beat the deadlines.
Understanding requirements- Translating challenging business  requirements into working software is a huge challenge.
Security issues- Softwares should be designed to protect vulnerabilities and cyber threats, which is not simple for software engineers to do. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Functional testing- This kind of testing ensures that the software works as it is intended.
Non-functional testing- Testing which checks  the performance, the usability and performance of the software.
Regression testing- This kind of test esnsure that the updates or new changes does not affect the functioning of the software.
Automated Testing- Kind of test that run tests to check efficiency.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is an art of designing and refining input propmpts to get responses from Artificial Intelligence tools. They improve accuracy and efficiency,save time and eases AI interaction. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
